# DESCRIPTION

This project is a work day scheduler.

The the current day is displayed at the top of the planner.
There are timeblocks for standard business hours.
Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past (gray), present (red), or future (green).
When the time block is clicked, the user is able to enter an event, and once the save button, at the end of the row, is clicked, the event is saved in local storage. 
After the page is refreshed, the saved events persist.
